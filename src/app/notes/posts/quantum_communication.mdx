## Introduction

Differential geometry is the study of curves, surfaces, and higher-dimensional manifolds using calculus and linear algebra. It provides the mathematical framework for understanding the geometry of curved spaces.

## Manifolds

A manifold is a topological space that locally resembles Euclidean space. Manifolds can be parameterized by local coordinate systems.

### Key Properties

- **Smooth Structure**: Manifolds have a well-defined notion of smoothness
- **Dimension**: The number of independent parameters needed to specify a point
- **Tangent Space**: At each point, the tangent space is a vector space of the same dimension as the manifold

## Tensors

Tensors generalize vectors and matrices to arbitrary dimensions. They are multilinear maps between vector spaces.

### Tensor Components
