## Full Notebook Experience Inside the Blog

This demo embeds a real JupyterLab-like interface inside the blog, including notebook cells and kernel-backed execution in the browser.

## How to reuse in any blog

Add this in any blog `.mdx` file:

```mdx
<JupyterLiteEmbed />
```

You can also target a specific notebook URL:

```mdx
<JupyterLiteEmbed src="https://your-jupyterlite-site/lab/index.html?path=notebooks/your_file.ipynb" height={780} />
```

## Notes

- This is client-side Jupyter via WebAssembly (no backend server required).
- For private notebooks, host your own JupyterLite build and pass its URL in `src`.
