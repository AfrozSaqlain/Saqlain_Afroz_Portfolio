## What is LaTeX?

LaTeX is a high-quality typesetting system used for producing professional-looking documents. It is widely used in academia and scientific communities for articles, books, and theses.

## Permission denied error

When running applications that use libraries like Matplotlib, you might encounter a `FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'latex'`. This happens when the application is configured to use LaTeX for text rendering but cannot find the `latex` executable on your system. On shared computing clusters, you typically don't have the `sudo` (administrator) privileges required to install software system-wide.

## Local Installation (without sudo rights)

The solution is to perform a local installation of a LaTeX distribution, such as TeX Live, within your home directory. This allows you to have a fully functional LaTeX environment without requiring root access.

<CodeBlock
    highlight="1-3"
    codes={[
  {
    code:
`# Download the installer
wget https://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/install-tl-unx.tar.gz

# Extract the archive and navigate into the directory
tar -xzf install-tl-unx.tar.gz
cd install-tl-*

# Run the installer and specify a local directory
perl ./install-tl --no-interaction -texdir ~/texlive/2025`, 
    language: "bash",
    label: "Terminal"
  }
]} />

## Update your PATH

Once the installation is complete, you need to add the `latex` executable to your system's `PATH`.

<CodeBlock
    highlight="1"
    codes={[
  {
    code:
`export PATH=~/texlive/bin/x86_64-linux:$PATH
export MANPATH=~/texlive/texmf-dist/doc/man:$MANPATH
export INFOPATH=~/texlive/texmf-dist/doc/info:$INFOPATH
source ~/.bashrc`, 
    language: "bash",
    label: "~/.bashrc"
  }
]} />

<CodeBlock
    highlight="1"
    codes={[
  {
    code:
`
echo 'export PATH=~/texlive/2025/bin/x86_64-linux:$PATH' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc`, 
    language: "bash",
    label: "~/.bashrc"
  }
]} />


## System-wide Installation (with sudo rights)

If you have `sudo` rights, you can install LaTeX system-wide using your distribution's package manager.

<CodeBlock
    highlight="1"
    codes={[
  {
    code:
`# On Linux
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install texlive-full`, 
    language: "bash",
    label: "Terminal"
  }
]} />

## Installing additional LaTeX packages

You might also need `tracklang.sty` and to check where it is in the Pacman repository, first run the following command:

<CodeBlock
    highlight="1"
    codes={[
  {
    code:
`# On Arch Linux
sudo pacman -Fy
pacman -F tracklang.sty
`, 
    language: "bash",
    label: "Terminal"
  }
]} />

You might see something like this:

<CodeBlock
    highlight="1"
    codes={[
  {
    code:
`extra/texlive-plaingeneric 2025.2-2 (texlive)
    usr/share/texmf-dist/tex/latex/tracklang/tracklang.sty
`, 
    language: "bash",
    label: "Terminal"
  }
]} />

Then simply run:

<CodeBlock
    highlight="1"
    codes={[
  {
    code:
`sudo pacman -S texlive-plaingeneric
`, 
    language: "bash",
    label: "Terminal"
  }
]} />
