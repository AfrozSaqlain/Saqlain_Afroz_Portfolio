## Interactive Python in Blog

This demo adds a notebook-like Python cell directly to the blog page using Pyodide (Python running in the browser via WebAssembly).

- Run Python scripts from the page
- Install Python packages with `micropip` (pure-python packages work best)
- Reuse this same component in any other `.mdx` post

<PythonPlayground
  initialCode={`import math
print("sin(pi / 2) =", math.sin(math.pi / 2))

total = sum(i * i for i in range(1, 6))
print("sum of squares 1..5 =", total)`}
/>

## Notes

- This is browser-side Python, not a full backend Jupyter server.
- Some scientific packages may not install unless compatible with Pyodide.
- If you need full Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb` UI, multi-cell state, kernels), the next step is embedding JupyterLite or connecting to a hosted notebook service.
